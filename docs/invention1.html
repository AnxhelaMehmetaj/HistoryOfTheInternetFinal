    <h4 class="alert-heading">Overview</h4>
    <p> "The Internet is the next big thing. Its on par with the wheel, fire, language, the printing press” begins this documentary from the History Channel talking about how the Internet is
        just as important and revolutionary as the wheel or the printing
        press.</p><br>

    <p class="mb-0">
        There is no doubt that the Internet has been a revolutionary invention, but how did it begin? To begin with, we will start with computers since they are the objects needed to access the Internet. During the Space war, the US government noticed how the Soviet Union was advancing quicker than them to space. Due to the US government not wanting to fall behind in space exploration, President Eisenhower created a Bureau at the Defense department called the Advance Research Projects Agency, mainly known as ARPA. ARPA would take care of space exploration and computer science research. Soon NASA took over and left computer research behind. In the earliest form of computers, computers could take up the space of an entire room. There were also very few of these computers since they were expensive and costly to maintain. As time went on, millions of dollars went into research of computers and networks. One notable form of network or communication that came from this would be that no matter if a line of communication between two computers was cut, there would be vast other options for the data to get from computer A to computer B. At some point many institutions were creating their own computers that contained their own protocols and if anyone else wanted to connect to them they would have to follow their same protocol. This wasn’t very efficient as now every computer had to be programmed the protocol of another computer before connecting to it and wasn’t very scalable. The creation of the ARPAnet was the answer to this problem, also known as the ARPA network. The ARPAnet connected all computers in its network to each other making scalability possible. However, using the ARPAnet was very esoteric and not many people knew how to use it. A couple years later, Tim Berners Lee, created the World Wide Web allowing regular people to connect to the ARPAnet.
        This was when the Internet as we know it today took off.

    <h4 class="alert-heading"> The internet:Behind the Web</h4>
    <p> The Internet enables million people with personal computer to communicate and connect. It's email, newsgroups and chat groups.It's also the worlds' largest market and shopping mall and its the linked to the websites world over
        information of every aspects of life and even the life after. This is telecommunication infrastructure for the 21st century.</p><br>

    <p class="mb-0">
        This is the age of the Internet a global network of the computer based on communication. at the turn of st century millions of people around the world are now online everyday to exchange messages, conduct business meet people and find information free of the limits of time, distance. Computer communication can be a tool of war as the US colonation did or against Saddam Hussein. No invention in history is grown so fast, to touch so many lives.It's something that we didn't see with the telephone, with the automobile,with the printing press. This is an absolutely incredible communications tool and it gives us instant access to things happens everyday everywhere.in Scope more emails is exchanged on the internet today then first class letters delivered by Us post Office. In financial importance, the internet generated three hundred and one billion dollars in business and was responsible for one third of the total us economic growth in 1998. It is our key component of culture
        and civilisation and yet no-one really controls it.
        Things that matters the most don't usually have anybody in charge! </p>
<p>At MIT the graduate student named Leonard Kleinrock begin applying Queueing theory to date to transmission. queue is a very simple structure. It's simply a system to you which arrives hanging around while and then leave. Like letters going through of posts' offices, kleinrock shows how packages of data would queue or line up at the communication network as they transited through.This way he could determine the overall speed of the network. He then showed how to speed up the internet by implementing the two techniques: demand access and distributed control. So the point of the demand access, you dont get it till you need is the key idea for effective resource sharing with data network. The second principal that he uncovered was the idea to use distributed control in network. Noone switch device authority should control the entire network, rather every switch should sharing that control. It should decide the routing procedure, decide how much traffic was allowed in, where it's going,
    when to do reassembly, when to do all the function in redistributed fashion.</p>
